# Trivia Game

### Overview
This project is a Trivia game using JavaScript and jQuery.

### How does it work?
After pressing the start button the game will give the user a question with 4 possible answers. The user needs to click on an answer, and has 20 seconds to do so. If the user is right - the user get a point. If the user is wrong - no point. If the user does not click an answer in 20 seconds - no point as well.

After 20 seconds or clicking an answer, there will be a visual feedback with color and text, that indicates if the user got a correct/wrong answer or if the time limit had passed. a few seconds after the feedback, a new set of question and answers will appear.

After 10 questions the user will get a feedback of how many questions were correct, and there will be an option to restart. 

### Why does it useful?
This is a great example of using (Javascript and JQuery) code to make interactive actions with the user while setting time restrictions. The code has some examples of disabling and disappearing buttons and a restart option.

### How do the user play?
The game will start after the user press the start button. For restarting the user will press the restert button.

In addition there is an option to play music during the game. The user needs to scroll to the buttom of the page and press play (the music will loop).
